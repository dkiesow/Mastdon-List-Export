# mastodon_scripts
mastodon_list.py is a simple script to export accounts from a Mastodon private list to a .CSV file. This allows easy downloading of the accounts for sharing with other users who may want to import the members of that list.

To use it, create a basic Mastodon app in Development: New Application in the web app. Take the token created there and put that and other required details in config.py
